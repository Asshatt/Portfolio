I attached rubber bands to each of the rolls, in order to maximize the friction between the paper and the roll, in order to get a smooth rotation.<br> I cut some cardboards to act as supports for the 2 rolls, and attached them to the sides of a larger piece of cardboard I had obtained prior to starting the project.<br> Next up was creating the begginings of what would become the wheel system. I hot glued a bearing onto the piece of cardboard, got another paper towel roll, and attached it to the sides of the bearing in order to get a working wheel. <br>Finally, I had to attach the paper onto the rolls and the rolls onto the supports in order to get the full skeleton working.</p>

I encountered many issues with the exact placement of the rollers, as they had to be pretty precise in order to get the desired smooth rotation. This was resolved by pure trial and error, which resulted in me having to take the entire system apart and put it back together multiple times.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Day 3</em></strong></p><p> Day 3 suffered pretty badly from the downscaling done previously, as that resulted in issues involving the system originally intended for the wheel becoming literally impossible to pull off. This was resolved by using a wire to extend the cardboard supports. Also worth noting was that I had no access to the aluminum coke can intended in the original plan, resulting in me having to improvise by wrapping aluminum tape around a newspaper.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Day 4</em></strong></p><p>Day 4 had probably the most issues. For one, the dynamo we installed back in day 2 was too weak to properly rotate the whole system, resulting in me having to create an entirely new frankenstein's monster of a dynamo by combining a stronger one with the frame of the original. Even still, the load was too much, resulting in me having to essentially redo practically everything from day 2, in order to lessen the load. Finally, came the fact that the soldering iron I bought was defective, and heated up at the wrong areas, resulting in me having to obtain another one.&nbsp;</p></div>

For one, I learned that I am more well suited to software design than I am on hardware. Seriously though, the most important lesson I learned from this project was how to act when the plan falls apart. </p><p>During the creation of any project, any plans that I had made will eventually fall, and this project was no exception. Wether its the size discrepancy, weak or straight up broken equipment, or even having to redo the whole thing from scratch, this project had many moments where my plans fell apart. What this project taught me was how to adapt during these situations. Instead of giving up, or restarting, instead find a way to make it work. The improvisational mindset that I had to shift to during moments of chaos sometimes even resulted in me creating something that ended up better than the original idea. </p><p>By the end, I was able to fully finish an actual working product, which is more than can be said for some other failed projects of mine. Overall, I'd say this project helped propel my designer mindset's evolution greatly.</p></div>
